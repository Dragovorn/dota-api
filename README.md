# Welcome to Dragovorn's DotaAPI!
---------------------------------
This is an aim to make an up to date API that is super user-friendly and easy to use for Java Developers, if you have found a bug please report it,
then if you think you are up to it fork and try to fix it, because this isn't my main job I cannot keep this as updated as I'd like to. If you want
a feature added, don't be afraid to make an issue with the enhancement tag, I'll take a look at it, alternatively you could fork and add it yourself and make a Pull Request
If you want to support me on this endeavor feel free to donate to me (will be bounced through twitch alerts so you can attach a message, and if I'm streaming I'll see it too!) [by clicking here!](https://www.twitchalerts.com/donate/dragovorn)
